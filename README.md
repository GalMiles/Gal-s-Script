# Gal-s-Script

Hi,

Unfortunately, I did not success to create the service like I was asked to. 
It was my first time ever I created a virtual machine by myself and learned about Jenkins and Flask.

I’m aware of the fact that I did not use Flask, because first I tried to write a Python program which by the way runs on the VM by 
running ‘MyScript’ -it excepts for input like:” curl localhost:8080/newCasesPeak..” and return the data . 
So I tried to change it with Flask as much as I had time to, I tried to take the logic from the python program and change the syntax for Flask but I had errors so I left what works for sure. 
I connected the VM to my Jenkins and Git.
