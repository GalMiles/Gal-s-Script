# Gal-s-Script

Hi,

Unfortunately, I did not success to create the service like I was asked to. 
It was my first time ever I created a virtual machine by myself and learned about Jenkins and Flask.

At first, I tried to write a Python program which by the way runs on the VM
by running ‘MyScript’ at the terminal VM -it expects for an input like:” curl localhost:8080/newCasesPeak..” and return the data and value.
After, I tried to change it with Flask as much as I had time to, I tried to take the logic from the python program and change the syntax for Flask but I had errors so I left what works for sure. 
I connected the VM to my Jenkins and Git.
